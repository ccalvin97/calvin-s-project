3. Speech Recognition Industrial Project  
•	Utilised Bi-LSTM to create language speech recognition system transforming audio data to text  
•	Audio → MFCC → NN → Target: CTC Loss (Beam Search, Edit Distance)  

4. Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques   
•	Achieved top 6% and accuracy of 0.11 for the RMSE  
•	DNN, Linear Regression & Stacking Model (Lasso, Elastic Net, SVR, Kernel Ridge, Bayesian Ridge, Ridge)   

5. Kaggle - Histopathologic Cancer Detection  
•	Two CNN structures, incl. Fastai DenseNet 201 & NASNet + global max/average pooling – Acc 95.9%  

6. Machine Learning Mobile Application – Second Hand Car Selling  
•	Model 1: Utilised NN to create a price prediction system  
•	Model 2: Utilised Latent Dirichlet Allocation to create a topic system  
•	Model 3: Utilised Google Cloud Vision API to create an image recognition system  
•	Workflow: Created ML models (Python) → Imported 3 models to API → Created a mobile application  

7. Machine Learning Startup Project – Crime Warning System   
•	Market Demand: Theft offences occurred at a rate of 45.8 per 1,000 population in 2017 in London   
•	Workflow: Dimension Reduction → ARIMA & LSTM → Validation → Output Prediction  
•	Function: Once users walks on a road at a specific time, they will be reminded if the time is dangerous  

8. Kaggle – Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster   
•	Achieved top 2% and accuracy of 83.7% for the prediction of the data  
•	Utilised 2 methods to predict labels respectively, incl. DNN & Random Forest
